# objectives:
# 1) make a seperate data point for every meeting 
# 2) make sure none conflict each other (modified version of all_possible_schedules)
# 3) get optimal schedules (do the same as in main)
# 4) return the most optional schedule
#
#
# side note: doing this in 24h time may be beneficial because we might add a gui later
