# autoschedule
 
use python -m pip install requests to install requests, the only dependancy at this time.

requests is not installed with python by default, so DO THIS.

this is a WORK IN PROGRESS.

As of right now, this can make a schedule. However, a GUI as well as a rudimentary discord bot are on the way! (The discord bot will have to be locally hosted cuz im broke)

As of right now, the only thing working is coursefetch.py. will get schedulemaker up next. after that its really only going to be frontend work. 

check this out too! https://github.com/ogvenocity/Optimal-Schedule-Maker-

# What it does

WARNING: This does not work anymore due to the opencourse API no longer being maintained. 

This will create a class schedule for a Foothill student using data from the course schedule and RateMyProfessor in order to achieve an optimal schedule.
