# autoschedule
 
use python -m pip install requests to install requests, the only dependancy at this time.

requests is not installed with python by default, so DO THIS.

this is a WORK IN PROGRESS. I will get this to create a schedule LATER. STOP ASKING. 

As of right now, the only thing working is coursefetch.py. will get schedulemaker up next. after that its really only going to be frontend work.
