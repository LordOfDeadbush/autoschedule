# autoschedule
 
use python -m pip install requests to install requests, the only dependancy at this time.

requests is not installed with python by default, so DO THIS.

this is a WORK IN PROGRESS.

As of right now, this can make a schedule. However, a GUI as well as a rudimentary discord bot are on the way! (The discord bot will have to be locally hosted cuz im broke)

As of right now, the only thing working is coursefetch.py. will get schedulemaker up next. after that its really only going to be frontend work.
